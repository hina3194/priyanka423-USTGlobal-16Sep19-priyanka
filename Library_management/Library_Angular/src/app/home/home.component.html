        <p>
          In any school, it's too hard to maintain library since they have
          students from 1st standard up to the graduation or post-graduation
          level, if students wants to take any particular books from library,
          it's very hard to search manually. To solve this, A.T.S.I. Library
          Module has been developed and designed that allows access to the
          library wherein the user can view availability of the books and also
          keep a check on the stock. The automated library system has been
          created with the intention of making libraries more organized and to
          make library stocking and accessing more simplified and structured. It
          uses technology in terms of RFID tagging, online stock checking,
          procurement, check-in and check-out, fine management and the status of
          a book. It has become an essential tool for large libraries which have
          a huge number of books since stock checking and procurement is a lot
          simpler using the various technological options and a structured
          approach.
